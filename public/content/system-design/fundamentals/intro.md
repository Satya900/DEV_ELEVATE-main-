Designing reliable and scalable systems requires understanding how different components interact, the trade-offs involved, and how to evolve systems as requirements grow.

---

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It focuses on how parts work together at scale.

### Key Goals

- Scalability: Handle growth in users, data, and traffic
- Reliability: Continue to operate correctly in the presence of failures
- Availability: Minimize downtime and ensure responsiveness
- Maintainability: Make the system easy to evolve and operate

## Core Building Blocks

1. Clients and API Gateways
2. Application Servers and Microservices
3. Databases (SQL/NoSQL) and Caches (Redis/Memcached)
4. Message Brokers and Event Streams (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
5. Load Balancers and CDNs
6. Observability (Logging, Metrics, Tracing)

---

## Common Trade-offs

- Consistency vs. Availability (CAP theorem)
- Latency vs. Throughput
- Simplicity vs. Flexibility

---

## Example: Scaling a Read-Heavy App

Start with a monolith and single database. As traffic increases:

1. Add a cache layer for frequent reads
2. Introduce read replicas
3. Split services by domain (user, content, analytics)
4. Use an event bus for asynchronous processing

## Next Steps

- Learn scalability patterns
- Explore microservices and service decomposition
- Practice designing systems with real-world constraints

> Tip: Always start with requirements and constraints before picking tools.
