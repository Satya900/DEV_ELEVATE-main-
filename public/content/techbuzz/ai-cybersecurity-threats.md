# AI in Cybersecurity: Double-Edged Sword

AI augments defenders with faster detection and response, but attackers also use AI to automate spear-phishing, evade detection, and craft novel exploits.

## Defensive capabilities

- Behavioral anomaly detection and automated triage.
- AI-driven playbooks for incident response.

## Emerging threats

Adversarial attacks, model poisoning, and misuse of generative models require new controls and rigorous governance.

Balance powerful tooling with strong controls and human review.
