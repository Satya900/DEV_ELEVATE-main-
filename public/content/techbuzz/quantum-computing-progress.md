# Quantum Computing: From Labs to Real Applications

Quantum hardware and algorithms have seen steady progress. Error mitigation techniques, hybrid classical-quantum workflows, and domain-specific algorithms are enabling early practical experiments.

## Promising domains

- Materials discovery and chemistry simulations.
- Specialized optimization tasks that benefit from quantum subroutines.

## Practical note

Most teams will access quantum resources through cloud providers and focus on hybrid workflows in the near term.

Quantum is promising but still an experimental frontier for most organizations.
