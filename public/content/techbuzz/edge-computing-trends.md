# Edge Computing: The Next Cloud Frontier

Edge computing extends cloud capabilities to the network edge — closer to data sources and users. It unlocks applications that need low latency, local processing, or resiliency to network outages.

## Use cases

- Autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.
- Real-time analytics for retail and IoT.

## Integration patterns

Hybrid cloud-edge topologies keep heavy lifting in the cloud while pushing inference and pre-processing to the edge. Orchestration and security are the core integration challenges.

Edge computing is a strategic layer, not a replacement for cloud — expect them to co-evolve.
