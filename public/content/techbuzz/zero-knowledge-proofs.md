# Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Privacy in Web3

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) let one party prove they know or own something without revealing the underlying data. In blockchains, ZKPs enable private transactions and off-chain computation with an on-chain proof.

## Why ZKPs are exciting

- Privacy by default for financial and identity use-cases.
- Scalability paths like ZK-rollups compress many transactions into a single proof.

## Applications

From private voting to confidential DeFi, ZKPs change the calculus for on-chain privacy and throughput. They also unlock new UX patterns where end-users don't sacrifice privacy for transparency.

Challenges remain: proof generation cost, developer ergonomics, and standardization across chains.

Zero-knowledge technology is shifting from cryptography labs into mainstream Web3 infrastructure.
