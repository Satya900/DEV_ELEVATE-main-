# Serverless: The Future of Cloud Native

Serverless is no longer just short-lived functions. The paradigm is expanding toward fully managed runtimes, event-driven platforms, and richer application patterns where developers focus on features instead of provisioning.

## Why teams choose serverless

- Reduced operational overhead for variable workloads.
- Faster iteration due to built-in scaling and managed services.

## Considerations

Cold starts, observability, and vendor lock-in remain considerations. The most practical approach blends serverless with predictable, managed components where appropriate.

Serverless is a spectrumâ€”use the right tool from the serverless toolbox for each problem.
