# Spatial Computing: Beyond Apple Vision Pro

Spatial computing opens a new interaction model where digital content exists in three-dimensional space. While premium headsets showcase possibilities, broader adoption will come from lighter, affordable experiences and compelling productivity apps.

## Opportunities

- Collaborative 3D design and mixed-reality meetings.
- New storytelling formats and immersive learning.

## Design priorities

Comfort, privacy, and intuitive interactions will determine which spatial experiences stick.

Spatial computing will grow as hardware and content ecosystems mature.
