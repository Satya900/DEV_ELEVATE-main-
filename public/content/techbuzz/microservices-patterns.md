# Microservices: Beyond the Basics

Microservices help scale teams and systems but introduce distributed complexity. Advanced patterns help manage data, transactions, and operational concerns.

## Patterns

- Sagas for reliable cross-service transactions.
- Event-driven design and idempotent consumers.

## Essentials

Invest in observability, contract testing, and automation. Team boundaries and ownership are as important as technical choices.

Applied correctly, microservices accelerate development velocity; applied poorly, they create chaos.
