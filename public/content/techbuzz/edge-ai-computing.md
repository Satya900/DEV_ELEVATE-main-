# Edge AI: Bringing Intelligence to Devices

Edge AI puts models directly on smartphones, cameras, drones, and sensors â€” reducing latency, improving privacy, and enabling offline capabilities. Instead of routing every signal to the cloud, devices can act locally with near-instant decisions.

## What changed

- Model compression, quantization, and specialized silicon (NPUs, TPUs) made on-device AI feasible.
- Efficient architectures strike a balance between accuracy and energy consumption.

## Why it matters

Low-latency control loops for robotics, instant on-device personalization, and private health monitoring are just a few applications. Edge AI reduces bandwidth costs and offers more robust, privacy-preserving solutions.

## Trade-offs and future

Developers must manage fragmented hardware, update models securely, and design for constrained compute. Hybrid cloud-edge systems will remain common: heavy training in the cloud, lightweight inference at the edge.

Edge AI is the practical bridge between research and real-world, always-on intelligent devices.
