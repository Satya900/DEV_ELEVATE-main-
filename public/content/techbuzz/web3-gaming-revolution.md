# Web3 Gaming: Play-to-Earn to Play-and-Own

Web3 promised to rewrite the economics of games by giving players true ownership of in-game assets. After early experiments, the space is shifting from speculative token-driven models toward sustainable, player-first economies.

## Emerging trends

- Interoperable items and composable economies.
- Tools for safe custody, onboarding, and fraud prevention.

## What success looks like

Great Web3 games treat ownership as a feature, not a gimmick. The best experiences blend compelling gameplay, fair economies, and simple UX for non-crypto natives.

## Open questions

Scalability, regulatory clarity, and aligning incentives to avoid extractive mechanics are critical for long-term health.

When done right, player-owned worlds can create new kinds of valueâ€”and new responsibilities for designers.
