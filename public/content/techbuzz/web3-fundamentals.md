# Web3 Fundamentals: Understanding Decentralized Web

Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, moving from centralized platforms to a decentralized, user-owned web. This article explores the core concepts, technologies, and implications of Web3.

## What is Web3?

Web3 is a vision for a new iteration of the World Wide Web that incorporates concepts like:

- **Decentralization:** Data and applications run on distributed networks rather than centralized servers
- **Blockchain Technology:** Immutable ledgers that enable trustless transactions
- **Token-based Economics:** Native digital assets that power network incentives
- **User Ownership:** Users control their own data and digital identity

## Key Technologies

### Blockchain Networks
Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and other blockchain networks form the backbone of Web3 applications.

### Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, enabling trustless agreements.

### Decentralized Applications (dApps)
Applications that run on decentralized networks rather than traditional servers.

## The Impact on Developers

Web3 offers new paradigms for building applications:

1. **Composability:** Build on top of existing protocols and smart contracts
2. **Open Source by Default:** Transparency and collaboration are core values
3. **New Business Models:** Token economies and DAOs enable novel approaches

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Scalability:** Blockchain networks face throughput limitations
- **User Experience:** Wallet management and gas fees can be complex
- **Regulation:** Evolving legal frameworks create uncertainty
