# Quantum Computing: Threat to Modern Cryptography

Quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm can break widely-used public-key systems. Preparing for the quantum era means adopting post-quantum algorithms and proactive key management.

## Action checklist

- Inventory crypto dependencies and prioritize critical assets.
- Run hybrid post-quantum cryptography pilots and follow NIST recommendations.

## Timeline and risk

Large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum machines are not yet widespread, but the risk of harvested encrypted data means planning and migration should start now for long-lived secrets.

Treat quantum readiness as a long-term security program.
