# Developer Experience: The New Competitive Edge

Developer Experience (DX) transforms tooling into a product. Smooth onboarding, clear docs, and fast feedback loops turn APIs and platforms into things developers enjoy using.

## Focus areas

- Comprehensive, example-driven docs and quickstarts.
- Fast local development and clear error messages.

## Business impact

Great DX shortens time-to-value and increases platform adoption. Treat developers as users and measure their success.

When DX is excellent, teams ship faster and stay longer.
