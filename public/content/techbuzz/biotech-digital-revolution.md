# Biotech Meets Digital: The Convergence

AI, automation, and cloud platforms are accelerating discovery in biology. From in-silico drug design to automated wet labs, digital tools are reshaping how we research and deliver care.

## Transformative trends

- AI-guided molecular design and simulation.
- Lab automation and digital twins for reproducible experiments.

## Ethics and governance

Privacy, consent, and regulatory alignment are critical when dealing with biological data and interventions.

The biotech-digital convergence promises breakthrough impact when pursued responsibly.
