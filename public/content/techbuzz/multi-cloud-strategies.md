# Multi-Cloud: Avoiding Vendor Lock-in

Multi-cloud isn't a silver bullet, but when used deliberately it increases resilience and negotiating leverage. The trick is to standardize abstractions and automate deployments across environments.

## Practical tips

- Use infrastructure-as-code to keep deployments reproducible.
- Abstract provider-specific services with adapters or service meshes.

## Cost vs benefit

Multi-cloud adds operational cost. Start small, identify failure scenarios you want to mitigate, and automate to reduce human toil.

Multi-cloud is strategy, not religionâ€”apply it where it reduces real risk.
