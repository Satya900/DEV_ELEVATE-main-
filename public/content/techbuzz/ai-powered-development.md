# AI-Powered Development Environments

From smart completion to automated refactors and test scaffolding, AI is becoming a force multiplier for developers. These tools reduce boilerplate and help engineers focus on higher-value work.

## Productivity wins

- Context-aware suggestions that speed up coding.
- Automated generation of tests, docs, and CI configs.

## Caveats

AI complements engineering skillsets but doesn't replace code review and testing. Maintain human oversight and treat AI suggestions as drafts.

Think of AI as an assistant that accelerates common tasks while leaving design and judgement to humans.
