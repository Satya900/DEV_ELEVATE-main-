# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning to code
* Providing helpful and constructive code reviews
* Sharing knowledge and helping others grow as developers
* Celebrating the achievements and progress of community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Dismissing or attacking someone for their level of experience or knowledge
* Gatekeeping or elitist behavior that discourages participation
* Spamming issues or pull requests with low-quality contributions
* Plagiarizing code or content without proper attribution
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

* GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Community forums and chat platforms
* Social media interactions related to the project
* Conference talks, meetups, or other public presentations about the project
* Any other forums where community members interact about the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[conduct@develevate.com](mailto:conduct@develevate.com).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Developer-Specific Guidelines

As a learning platform for developers, we have additional expectations:

### Code Quality and Reviews
* Provide constructive feedback that helps others learn and improve
* Be patient when reviewing code from developers at different skill levels
* Focus on the code, not the person writing it
* Suggest improvements rather than just pointing out problems
* Acknowledge good practices and clever solutions

### Learning Environment
* Remember that everyone is at a different stage in their learning journey
* Encourage questions and create a safe space for learning
* Share resources and knowledge generously
* Avoid "RTFM" responses - instead, guide people to helpful resources
* Celebrate progress and milestones, no matter how small

### Technical Discussions
* Stay on topic and keep discussions productive
* Provide evidence or examples to support technical claims
* Be open to different approaches and solutions
* Admit when you don't know something - it's okay to learn together
* Avoid technology wars or language superiority debates

### Contribution Guidelines
* Follow the project's coding standards and conventions
* Write clear commit messages and pull request descriptions
* Test your code before submitting
* Be responsive to feedback and willing to make changes
* Help maintain documentation and keep it up to date

## Reporting and Support

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting us at [conduct@develevate.com](mailto:conduct@develevate.com).

For urgent matters or if you need immediate support, you can also reach out to:
* Project maintainers directly through GitHub
* Community moderators in our discussion forums

When reporting, please include:
* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
* Any additional information that may be helpful

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing positive contributions to our community. We maintain
a [Contributors Hall of Fame](CONTRIBUTORS.md) to celebrate those who:
* Consistently demonstrate our community values
* Help newcomers feel welcome and supported
* Contribute high-quality code, documentation, or educational content
* Go above and beyond to help others learn and grow
