## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
- GitHub repository interactions (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Community forums and chat channels
- Social media interactions related to the project
- Conference presentations and meetups
- Any other official community spaces

## Enforcement

### üìß **Reporting**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Primary Contact**: [maintainer-email@develevate.com]  
**Secondary Contact**: [community@develevate.com]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### üîç **Investigation Process**

1. **Report Received**: We acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Initial Review**: Community leaders review the report within 48 hours
3. **Investigation**: Gather additional information if needed
4. **Decision**: Determine appropriate response within 7 days
5. **Action**: Implement consequences and communicate to relevant parties
6. **Follow-up**: Monitor situation and provide support as needed

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Enforcement Guidelines**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### **1. Correction**
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### **2. Warning**
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### **3. Temporary Ban**
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### **4. Permanent Ban**
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for Educational Content

Since Develevate is a learning platform, we have additional guidelines:

### üìö **Educational Standards**
* **Accuracy**: Ensure technical content is correct and up-to-date
* **Clarity**: Write explanations that are accessible to the target audience
* **Completeness**: Provide comprehensive examples and test cases
* **Progression**: Structure content with appropriate difficulty progression

### üéØ **Inclusive Learning**
* **Multiple Learning Styles**: Support visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners
* **Accessibility**: Ensure content is accessible to users with disabilities
* **Cultural Sensitivity**: Avoid examples that exclude or alienate certain groups
* **Language**: Use clear, simple language and define technical terms

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you should notify the project maintainers with a concise description
of your grievance. Appeals will be handled by a different community leader than
the one who made the original enforcement decision.

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing positive contributions to our community:

* **Contributor Spotlights**: Monthly recognition of helpful community members
* **Mentorship Awards**: Recognition for those who help newcomers
* **Quality Contributions**: Highlighting excellent code, documentation, and educational content

## Updates

This Code of Conduct may be updated periodically. Community members will be
notified of significant changes, and feedback will be welcomed during revision
periods.
