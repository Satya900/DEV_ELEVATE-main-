## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Firebase Console Setup (REQUIRED)

**Important**: The code is ready, but you must enable Google authentication in Firebase Console:

1. **Go to**: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. **Select Project**: `develevate-93ebd`
3. **Navigate to**: Authentication → Sign-in method
4. **Enable**: Google provider
5. **Set**: Support email address
6. **Save**

**That's it!** No code changes needed. The OAuth credentials you have are configured in Firebase Console backend.

### OAuth Credentials Note

Your Google OAuth credentials are **already configured** in your Firebase project backend. You **do NOT** need to add them to any `.env` file or code. Firebase handles everything automatically through the Firebase Console configuration.

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Sign Up Page

1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Sign In"

### Step 3: Test Google OAuth

1. Click the **Google icon button** (first button in the OAuth section)
2. A popup should appear with Google sign-in
3. Select your Google account
4. Grant permissions
5. You should be redirected to the home page (Sign Up) or profile page (Sign In)

### Step 4: Verify in Firebase Console

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
2. You should see your Google account listed
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Check `users` collection - your profile should be there
5. Check `userProgress` collection - your progress should be there

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### For New Users (First Time Sign-In)

1. User clicks "Sign up with Google"
2. Google OAuth popup appears
3. User selects Google account
4. Firebase creates authentication record
5. **Automatically created**:
   - User profile in `users` collection
   - User progress in `userProgress` collection
   - Display name from Google account
6. User is redirected to home page
7. User can immediately start using the platform

### For Existing Users

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth popup appears
3. User selects Google account
4. Firebase authenticates user
5. Existing profile is loaded
6. User is redirected to profile page
7. All previous progress is preserved

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Nothing happens when I click Google button"

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Google provider is enabled in Firebase Console
3. Pop-ups are not blocked by browser
4. Internet connection is active

### Issue: "Unauthorized domain" Error

**Solution:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
2. Add `localhost` (for development)
3. Save changes

### Issue: "Google provider not enabled"

**Solution:**
1. Follow the Firebase Console setup steps above
2. Make sure you clicked "Save" after enabling

### Issue: Error message in UI

**Check:**
- Browser console for detailed error
- Firebase Console → Authentication → Logs
- Network tab in browser DevTools

## 📊 Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

```
User clicks Google button
        ↓
handleGoogleSignUp/SignIn called
        ↓
signInWithGoogle() in AuthContext
        ↓
Firebase signInWithPopup()
        ↓
Google OAuth popup opens
        ↓
User authenticates
        ↓
Firebase receives user data
        ↓
Check if user profile exists
        ↓
    ├─→ New user: Create profile + progress in Firestore
    └─→ Existing user: Load existing data
        ↓
Update local state (currentUser, userProfile, userProgress)
